We know that artists create paintings on a canvas. But what if we can paint on air just by waving our hands. So, in this project, we are going to build an air canvas using OpenCV and Python.

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library for performing various advanced image processing tasks.

We’ll use color detection and segmentation techniques to achieve this objective.

Here, we’re going to use a green object to simulate a pencil for the canvas.
